## üß† Data Models

### B3 Robot State:

```js
robot = {
  direction: 0 | 90 | 180 | 270, // North, East, South, West
  positionX: 0-4,
  positionY: 0-4,
  isOnBox: Boolean
}
```

### Game Board:

```js
[
  [0,0,2,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,2,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,0,0],
  [0,0,0,2,1] // 1 = Exit, 2 = Box
]
```

### Levels:

Levels are stored in an object:

```js
levels = {
  1: [...],
  2: [...],
  // ...
}
```
